	<p>UC Santa Cruz Confessions continues a tradition of providing Banana Slugs with an anonymous tool to share their stories with the entire student body. Confessions bring students together online and help to establish a concept of UCSC culture that otherwise wouldn't be possible on such a decentralized campus.
<br />
So what are you waiting for? Submit a confession; share your thoughts on a campus issue! Alert everyone to the success of that crazy party you threw! Share those embarrassing details you don't want to tell anyone else. When you submit a confession, your name is not associate with it, even to those running the page. Your secret is safe with us.
